# PROJECT - Soft-Drinks-List 


# Our Aim For Doing This Project: 
The main aim for doing this project was to enhance our skills and put all our knowledge to the test  by combining all our recently achieved set of skills to produce a product, whereby you can add to, remove from, update and read from a list. The list in my case of Soft Drinks, gets saved to a MySQL database where you have all your records saved for future reference. 



# My expectations of the challenge:

My pre-project expectations of the challenge was that I knew that it would be straightforward, but I also knew that I would encounter errors along the way that I would have to sort, which did end up happening. Something as simple as missing a comma can have a great impact on your project and just reading over it again and proofreading it can lessen the chances of your code breaking due to minor errors. 


# What went well? What didnt go so well?
I really enjoyed this project, I felt that I had a good grasp on Postman which always seems to work nicely for me and getting it to save to a MySQL database. Structuring my code in eclipse also went well, having been through why we structure files and classes in a certain way helped me in understanding why we do it in a particular way. The project works and is functional which is definitely the best thing that went well. I particularly liked doing the repo and making my own methods.

I did encounter some minor setbacks, such as, having conflicts when pushing to github but was able to solve them pretty quickly in github. Another issue I encountered was in my pom file which kept giving me errors but managed to solve it. 
Having a small issue in your pom file can affect your whole project is what I came to find out when I tried running my code with errors in my pom. 


# Stretch goals for the project:
I would in future as a stretch project, add more tables and entity relationship diagrams to increase the functional capability of the program. Maybe adding a food section / starters section to get a menu style of a project going. Maybe even add customers, orders tables etc. I made the decision to keep it simple to reduce the scope for errors to occur io like that we can alway build upon it if we have to, I was making sure the foundations work before adding more levels to the code. 

# MY ERD 
- Before starting my project it was important that i made my erd so i can use it as a guidance and refer back to it
